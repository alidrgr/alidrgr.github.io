#About me

I'm Ali, a graduate student of Computer Science at the [University of Tehran](https://cist.ut.ac.ir/en/). 
My research mostly focuses on Natural Language Processing, but I'm also interested in AI Alignment, and Mechanistic Interpretability. Previously, I was a student of Computer Engineering at the [Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences](https://iasbs.ac.ir/).
