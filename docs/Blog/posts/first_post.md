# First Post

Writing never reaches a final state. Every paragraph can be rewritten. Every sentence can be rephrased. And, of course, every word can be swapped with a synonym. There are always a few rough edges to polish. So, I'd rather see these posts not as perfected writings but as published drafts. There is no optimal point for a text. You start with a few words, and after some iterations, end up with a text that looks not perfect but fine. That's why this blog is called "Unconvex Drafts."
